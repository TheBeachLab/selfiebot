With coordinates starting at bottom left. The coordinates numbers are the dimensions in mm x 40.

The resolution of the PNG does not affect the coordinates, so the coordinates are absolute of the machine.

40 units per mm is the resolution of the machine.

If the origin is changed the coordinate sign changes. Up and right movements relative to the origin are positive.
